# check compatability between crisis-free/all-cause envelope difference and the crisis deaths we have
# set to crisis-included to crisis-free if the latter is larger

# crisis deaths get broken down into natural disasters and collective violence
# if there is no envelope difference they get added prorata within crisis-free envelope
# need to make any adjustments for this here?
